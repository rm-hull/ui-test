When you push to this branch, your site will be automatically published to http://youraccount.github.io/ui-test.

The API is available on http://youraccount.github.io/ui-test/api/results.json

Time to complete approx 45 mins

1. Hit the API
2. Render out response in suitable markup
3. Add a simple visual design

Use any libraries, resources or tools as required.

Understanding and your approach is as important as the final output so discuss

time.
